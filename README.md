This GitHub repository houses a compact yet powerful web browser application developed using a modern stack of technologies. This browser serves as an educational project, providing an ideal platform for learning and experimenting with Electron, React, Vite, Zustand, and Ant Design for UI.

## Key Features:

- ⚡Electron: The project leverages Electron, a popular framework for building cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies. This means that the web browser is not just limited to the web; it can be used as a standalone application on various operating systems.

- ⚛️ React: The user interface of this web browser is crafted using React, a widely adopted JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces. This choice ensures a responsive and intuitive browsing experience.

- 🏃‍♀️ Vite: Vite, the fast and lightweight build tool for web applications, is employed to streamline the development process. With Vite's quick development server and efficient build system, the web browser can be developed and tested with ease.

- 🐻 Zustand: State management is handled with Zustand, a minimalistic yet powerful state management library for React. It simplifies the process of managing application state, making it easier to develop and maintain the browser.

- 🎨 Ant Design: The user interface is enhanced with Ant Design, a comprehensive design system for building elegant and consistent user interfaces. Ant Design components provide a polished and professional look and feel for the browser.
